In recent years, the large increase of machine accessible data has lead researchers
to develop sophisticated methods of organizing and using the information.
In particular, the advancement of information extraction techniques has allowed
millions of facts to be extracted from across the web.
This is evidenced by the renewed interests in knowledge graphs and knowledge bases
from companies and
researchers~\cite{bellare2013woo,chang2014typed,dong2014knowledge,niu2012deepdive}.

Knowledge graphs efficiently store and manage the linking of facts.
Knowledge bases are equivalent to knowledge graphs but with and additional
inference engine. 
Inference engines allow the discovery of facts that are not explicitly
mentioned in the knowledge graph.
Researchers currently pair probabilities with extracted facts and rules to
represent the natural uncertainty found in language and extraction systems.
These stores are called probabilistic knowledge bases~\cite{chen2014knowledge}.
When performing inference, probabilistic knowledge bases consider the uncertainty
of facts upon evaluation.

This demonstration describes a question answering application developed to demonstrate
a new probabilistic knowledge base begin developed in the data science research group at the University of Florida.
Attendees will gain an understanding of the usefulness of a probabilistic
knowledge base and the techniques developed for large-scale knowledge base
management.
The question answering application allows users to see example queries to a
probabilistic knowledge base and also to understand how probabilistic knowledge bases work in general.

Further, we enumerate our contributions as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-0.5em}
\item We develop a question answering architecture that leverages a probabilistic knowledge base for answer generation.

\vspace{-0.5em}
\item We develop a trustworthiness value for each question answered over three difference knowledge bases.

\vspace{-0.5em}
\item We describe an application for users to interact with a probabilistic knowledge
base. Users can add and removing facts before to recompute answer
trustworthiness.
\end{itemize}
