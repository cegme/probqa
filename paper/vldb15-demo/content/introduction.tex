In recent years, the large increase of machine accessible data has lead research
to develop sophisticated methods of organizing and using the information.

Knowledge graphs have received renewed interests from companies and
researchers~\cite{dong2014knowledge,chang2014typed,bellare2013woo,niu2012deepdive}.

In this paper, we describe a question answering system developed over a probabilistic 
knowledge base.

Our contributions is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item We develop a question answering architecture that leverages a probabilistic knowledge base.
\item We describe a method for users to interact with a knowledge base, adding and removing facts.
\item Develop a trustworthiness value for each question answered by the knowledge base.
\end{itemize}
