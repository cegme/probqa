\section{K-Hop Overview}

In this section, we describe the in-database incremental probabilistic inference system.
Shall we send a preprint of Kun's paper to ArXiv so I can cite it?

\subsection{Data Set}
In this subsection we describe the Freebase data set and how we obtain the rules for use with the Khop method.
