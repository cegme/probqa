As knowledge bases are gaining appeal from large companies and organizations,
they high volatility of facts is making probabilistic knowledge bases,
knowledge bases with uncertainty attached to each fact, the next frontier for
large entities.
In this demonstration we present question answering application over a large probabilistic knowledge bases.
This demonstration will allow attendees to interact with three large
probabilistic knowledge bases, one with primarily deterministic rules, and
another with a large amount of rules extracted from the web and a third from a
continuously learning system.
In addition, the use of a probabilistic knowledge base allows the system to
quantify the truthfulness of evaluated questions by computing the joint
probabilities of facts that support the answer to each questions.
We leverage a state of the art question answering system and perform all
knowledge base computations including grounding and inference inside of the
PostgreSQL Relational Database Management System.
We believe this demonstration to be the first to demonstrate such an
application over a probabilistic knowledge base.
