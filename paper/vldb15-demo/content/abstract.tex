As knowledge bases gain appeal from large companies and organizations,
the high volatility of facts is making \emph{probabilistic} knowledge bases,
knowledge bases with uncertainty attached to each fact, the next frontier.
In this demonstration, we a present question answering application over a large probabilistic knowledge bases.
This demonstration allows users to interact with large probabilistic knowledge
bases that contain uncertainty in facts and correlations encoded as first-order
soft rules, which are automatically extracted from the knowledge base. 
In addition, the use of a probabilistic knowledge base allows the system to
quantify a confidence score of evaluated questions by computing the joint
probabilities of facts that support the answer to each question.
We leverage a popular question answering system for language translation, and we perform
knowledge base computations including, grounding and inference, inside of the
PostgreSQL Relational Database Management System.
We believe this demonstration to be the first to demonstrate such an
application over probabilistic knowledge bases.
