As knowledge bases gain appeal from large companies and organizations,
the high volatility of facts is making \emph{probabilistic} knowledge bases,
knowledge bases with uncertainty attached to each fact, the next frontier.
In this demonstration we a present question answering application over a large probabilistic knowledge bases.
This demonstration allows attendees to interact with three large
probabilistic knowledge bases, one with primarily deterministic rules, and
another with a large amount of rules extracted from the web and a third from a
continuously learning system.
In addition, the use of a probabilistic knowledge base allows the system to
quantify the truthfulness of evaluated questions by computing the joint
probabilities of facts that support the answer to each questions.
We leverage a popular question answering system for language translation and we perform all
knowledge base computations --- including, grounding and inference ---  inside of the
PostgreSQL Relational Database Management System.
We believe this demonstration to be the first to demonstrate such an
application over a probabilistic knowledge bases.
